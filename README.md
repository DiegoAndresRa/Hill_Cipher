This is an implementation of the Hill Cipher in the C programming language. The Hill Cipher is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher that uses matrices to encrypt and decrypt messages.

## Features

- **Limited to a 2x2 matrix for the key:** This program is designed to encrypt and decrypt messages using a square key matrix of size 2x2.
- **Implemented in C:** The code is written in C, allowing for fast and efficient execution.
- **Simple Interface:** It offers a simple and easy-to-use command-line interface for encrypting and decrypting messages.

## Run Locally

1. **Compilation:** Compile the program using a compatible C compiler.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DiegoAndresRa/Hill_Cipher
    cd Hill_Cipher
    ./run
    ```

2. **Encryption:** To encrypt a message, run the program and follow the on-screen instructions.

    ```
    ./run
    C
    ```

3. **Decryption:** To decrypt a message, run the program and follow the on-screen instructions.

    ```
    ./run
    D
    ```
## Requirements

- Compatible C compiler (such as GCC)
- Operating system compatible with C
